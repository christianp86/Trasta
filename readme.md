## Calculating the CO2 footprint
I am still researching the CO2 footprint for each individual trash type.
These figures can never be 100% accurate, as it differs how the trash is being managed locally.
But they should provide a rough picture what it impact our consumption has.s

# Overview
| Trash type                                          | Aluminum | Diapers | Glass   | Organic | Other   | Paper   | Plastic |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  CO2 Footprint waste disposal (in kg per kg trash)  | unknown  | unknown | 2.15    | unknown | unknown | 1,42    | 2,89    |
|  CO2 Footprint production (in kg)                   | unknown  | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown |
